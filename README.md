# Digital Image Processing Lab Journals

This repository contains my journals for the Digital Image Processing (DIP) lab. Each journal consists of different tasks and exercises that build on fundamental concepts related to image processing using Python. Below is a summary of the tasks covered in each journal.

## Journal 1: Basic Introduction to Python

In this journal, we covered the basics of Python programming. The primary task was to manually add two 2D matrices. The goal was to familiarize ourselves with matrix operations using Python's list and numpy libraries.

### Task:
- Add two 2D matrices manually.

## Journal 2: Introduction to OpenCV and Image Channel Manipulation

In this journal, we explored the OpenCV library to process images. The focus was on understanding how to read images, manipulate channels, and convert images to grayscale using both manual and OpenCV methods. The final task involved comparing grayscale images obtained manually and through OpenCV's built-in function.

### Task:
- Use OpenCV to process images and manipulate channels.
- Convert an image to grayscale using a manual approach.
- Convert the same image to grayscale using OpenCVâ€™s `cvtColor` function.
- Compare the two grayscale images by calculating the maximum difference.
